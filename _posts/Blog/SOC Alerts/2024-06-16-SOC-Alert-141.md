_Figure 4 Event log_  

Inputting the source IP's address into Letdefend's Log management section provides several event logs. The event log of interest shown in figure 4, shows the malicious URL is destined to for port 80. Port 80 is an unsecure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), used to transmit and receive unencrypted web traffic. The Request URL uses HTTP, so it was sent to port 80. The action was not blocked,so the host computer will be contained (Figure 5).
