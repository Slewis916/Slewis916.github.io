Considering this, the threat actor may have spoofed the IP address to gain access to the network and attempted to download the malicious word document. I downloaded the zipped file on a windows 20 flare-vm, and unzipped it revealing the INVOICE PACKAGE LINK TO DOWNLOAD.docm file.

 When the word document is opened from the temp folder, it initiates a powershell command which downloads a file from filetransfer.io, a malicious domain (figure 6). Furthermore, there were changes to registry keys associated with Microsoft office and Windows installer. Additionally, temporary files were created in the user's AppData directory by Microsoft word and powershell processes which could be malicious activity.
