A medium alert was received March 13, 2021 at 08:20 PM. The sender’s address was 172.16.17.56. The alert contained an attachment ‘ORDER SHEET & SPEC.xlsm’, which is a downloadable file. I filtered through the logs using the source address and discovered two firewall logs related to the source address.

The source address was analyzed in LetsDefend’s EDR and it was discovered it belonged to primary user Sofia2020. The user’s last login was October 25, 2020 at 11:44 PM. Considering this, the user’s IP address may have been spoofed.

# Conclusion

A medium alert was received  on March 20, 2021 due to a suspicious excel file. Analysis of the source address showed the host came from within LetsDefend from user Sofia2020. The user had not accessed the computer since October 25, 2020. Therefore, the IP address was spoofed. The file’s hash was uploaded to VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis, and was determined to be malicious. The zipped file was then uploaded into AnyRun, and also determined to be malicious. The summary of the indicators of compromise displayed a malicious domain. The domain was searched in Cisco Talos Intelligence, and found to be located in Brazil. The domain’s reputation was untrusted. Considering this, host Sofia’s computer was contained. To prevent a reoccurrence of this event, two-factor authentication should be implemented or a network firewall should be utilized. If the orginal intended user is no longer accessing the computer then the login and access should be disabled.
