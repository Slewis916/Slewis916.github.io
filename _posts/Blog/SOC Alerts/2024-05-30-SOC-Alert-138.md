A medium alert was received March 13, 2021 at 08:20 PM. The sender’s address was 172.16.17.56. The alert contained an attachment ‘ORDER SHEET & SPEC.xlsm’, which is a downloadable file. I filtered through the logs using the source address and discovered two firewall logs related to the source address.
