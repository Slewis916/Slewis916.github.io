## Scenerio:
One of the employees has received a suspicious document attached in the email. When the e-mail flow is examined, it is seen that there is a suspicious Office file. Employees forward the email to the security team for analysis.

When L1 analysts scan the suspicious file with several different scanning tools, they see that it does not contain VBA macros. Since the file format is similar to phishing, they forwarded the suspicious Office file to you for detailed analysis.

## Analysis:

The attackers used a function to make the malicious VBA macros they have prepared run when the document is opened. The attackers change the cell name to 'auto_open' to make Excel 4.0 macros work to provide the same functionality (Figure 1).

The address of the first cell where Excel 4.0 macros will run in the malicious Office document is 'Doc4!BA7' (Figure 1).

The function 'exec' is used to start a process in the operating system in the document (Figure 3).

The "Living off the Land Binaries and Scripts" (LOLBAS) tool used in the Excel 4.0 macros was Regsvr32.exe (Figure 3).

The excel file is uploaded to Virus Total and it is determined to be malicious.

Regsvr32.exe registers and unregisters DLL and ActiveX controls in Windows Registry. In this excel file, Regsvr.exe 
registered and executed 'iroto.dll', a malicious DLL file (Figure 6). Iroto.dll is capable of loading and rewriting excutables, to execute hidden code.

Utilizing labs.inquest.net, I was able to determine the file was last modified by the username Amanda (Figure 7).
