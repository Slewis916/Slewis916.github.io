## Analyzing a PCAP file with Wireshark  ðŸŒŠðŸ¦ˆ

The pcap file 'case1.pcap' was opened in Wireshark. I filtered through the network traffic log using the 'smtp' filter to examine the email traffic associated with the smtp protocol.

The SMTP session begins with the server indicating it is ready to proceed with communication by responding with response code 220. The SMTP command 'EHLO' identifies itself to the server and provides a list of commands supported by the sevrer.
Response code 250 is the server identifying itself (figure 2).

Further inspection of the network traffic log indicates the email address that sent the email is : test@letsdefend.io.

The source IP address that sends the 'EHLO' message in SMTP traffic is: 172.16.8.136 (figure 5).
