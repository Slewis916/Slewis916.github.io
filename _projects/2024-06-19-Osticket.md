###  osTicket Helpdesk Deployment (Microsoft Azure)
![osTicket Dashboard Screenshot](/assets/img/logo copy.png)

### This project simulates the deployment and configuration of a helpdesk ticketing system using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and osTicket. This project includes request handling, escalation workflows, and ticket lifecycle documentation.  

I used a virtual machine hosted on Microsoft Azure to:
- Install and configure osTicket on Ubuntu
- Set up MySQL database and connect it to the osTicket platform
- Simulate a basic helpdesk workflow (ticket creation, assignment, escalation, closure)
- Align lifecycle stages with real-world issues
