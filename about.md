## Hello,

I'm **Jashawna Lewis**, *pronounced* **Ja/Sha/Na**.<br>
I am a recent graduate from the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program with a background in Laboratory Medicine. <br>

I am excited to leverage my diverse background in Laboratory Medicine to bring a fresh perspective to the digital security realm. <br>

I have up-skilled in areas such as network security, incident response and threat hunting. <br>

As a Cybsersecurity analyst it is our duty to protect our client's assets from threat actors by identifying, preventing and responding to security incidents. From a medical prosepctive this is similar to my role as a Medical technologist in Virology. I analyze the patient's bodily fluids to identify viruses or bacteria, to assist doctors and nurses in treating their patient.  I believe my hunger for learning and a passion for solving complex problems will make me a great addition to the Cybersecurity field.<br>

In my spare time, I enjoy fishing, anime, or gaming.<br>
