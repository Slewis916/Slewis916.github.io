Hi, I'm Jashawna Lewis 
pronounced (Ja-Sha-Na)

I am a recent graduate from the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program with a background in Laboratory Medicine. 
I am excited to leverage my diverse background in Laboratory Medicine to bring a fresh perspective to the digital security realm. 
I have up-skilled in areas such as network security, incident response and threat hunting. 
I have a hunger for learning and a passion for solving complex problems.
In my spare time, I enjoy fishing and gaming.
