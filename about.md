title: Hello and welcome!
---

I'm **Jashawna Lewis (pronounced Ja-sha-na)** â€” a recent graduate of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program with a background in Laboratory Medicine. <br>
Iâ€™m transitioning into the cybersecurity field with hands-on training in network security, incident response, and threat hunting.
Iâ€™m passionate about drawing connections between my past and future. As a Medical Technologist in Virology, I analyzed patient samples to identify infections â€” helping providers make life-saving decisions. As a Security Analyst, I aim to detect, analyze, and respond to digital threats with the same urgency and attention to detail.<br>
I bring a unique perspective, a hunger for learning, and a deep love of solving complex problems.<br>
In my free time, youâ€™ll usually find me gaming, watching anime, or fishing â€” anything that helps me recharge and stay curious.
